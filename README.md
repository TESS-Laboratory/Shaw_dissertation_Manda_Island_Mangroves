# shaw_dissertation_Manda_Island_Mangroves
Script for research focussed on anaylsis of the Manda Island Conservancy Project Mangroves. 
Full script and explanatroy notes are avaliable within the Notebook 'Amy Shaw Dissertation Notebook'. 
All csv files downloaded from QGIS, containing data for every year for both MICP and Lamu County are stored in the 'data' folder.
All plots, graphs and visusalisations are saved within the 'plots' folder. 
All other notebooks hold old code which has been duplicated within the main script and are therefore redunant.
